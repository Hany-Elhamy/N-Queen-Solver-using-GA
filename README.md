# N-Queen-Solver-using-GA
The N-Queens Problem Solver Project

Objective: The project aims to develop an intelligent system capable of solving the N-Queens problem for various board sizes.

Overview: The N-Queens problem is a classic chessboard puzzle where the objective is to place N queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. Threatening means no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Key Features:

User-Defined Board Size: The value of N, representing the board size and the number of queens, can be chosen by the user.
Challenge: Arrange N queens on an N×N chessboard, ensuring that no two queens attack each other.
Difficulty: The restrictive nature of queen movements; they can traverse horizontally, vertically, and diagonally.
Project Scope: The project involves exploring multiple algorithms to efficiently find solutions to this puzzle.

MY Role:
Designed an intelligent system to solve the N-Queens problem for various board sizes. Implemented a genetic algorithm to efficiently find solutions while ensuring no two queens threaten each other on the chessboard
